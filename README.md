# Collection of Raycast Scripts

This is a collection of my personal scripts for the Raycast app. Raycast is an app that allows you to run scripts and commands from your menu bar. You can find more information about Raycast [here](https://raycast.com/).

## Installation

## List of commands

### Active Logging

Best used with `crontab` to schedule the script to run at a specific time.

- [Log what you're doing to a .txt file](./logging/log-to-txt.sh)
- [Log what you're doing to Obsidian daily note](./logging/log-to-txt-with-time.sh)
